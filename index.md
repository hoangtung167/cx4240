## I. Introduction
Scientists at Los Alamos Laboratory have recently found a use for massive amounts of data generated by a “constant tremor” of fault lines where earthquakes are most common **[1-3]**. This data has previously been disregarded as noise. However, now, it has been proven useful through the lens of Machine Learning (ML) **[1-2]**. Following their recent publications, our goal is to build _Machine Learning regression models for the Laboratory Earthquake problem_ that if applied to real data, might help predict earthquakes before they happen
